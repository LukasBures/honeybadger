# The task: Take-home project for Software Developer position (2023)

**Estimated time:** 1-2 hours

Create a production-ready web endpoint that accepts a JSON payload as a POST request and sends an alert to a Slack channel if the payload matches desired criteria. This project should be straight-forward ‚Äî please don‚Äôt spend more than two hours on it! If anything in the instructions is unclear, please send your questions to us. If you hit the two hour mark and you aren‚Äôt done, please send what you have at that point. 

## **Requirements**

- The alert should only be sent to the Slack channel if the payload is a spam notification.
- The Slack alert should include the email address included in the payload

All other decisions are up to you! Pick your preferred platform/language/framework, etc., and don‚Äôt feel limited by what‚Äôs described here‚Ä¶ a little extra polish can go a long way. üòÅ 

## **Deliverable**

When completing your application, please send a link to your code, including instructions on how to deploy it.
